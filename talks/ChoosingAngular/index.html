      <h4>Intro</h4>
      <p>
        I gave this talk in November 2016, I had pretty confidently thrown my hat in the Angular ring rather than 
        the React ring by that point. I still prefer Angular to React. The gist of my talk was that the React ecosystem 
        requires lots of technology decisions and that makes it a poor choice for a first JavaScript framework. I started 
        out trying to learn React before I moved to Angular. I prefered that in Angular there was a defined way to do 
        anything you needed to do rather than any one of 15 different routes in the React ecosystem. 
      </p>
      <h4>Talk Overview</h4>
      <p>
        The talk was based on a blog post I read titled Choosing Ember Over React in 2016. After I read that article, I 
        started thinking about the reasons why I chose Angular 2 over React. One of the main reasons was that everything 
        you might need to do in an application requires you to make a technology decision with React. That obviously confers 
        a lot of flexibility for more experienced devs, but for people picking up their first JavaScript framework, it's hard 
        to make those decisisons without having a frame of reference or not knowing what 90% of those technologies do. That 
        problem does not exist in Angular. You do everything <em>the Angular Way™</em>
      </p>
      <p>  
        Aside from the required technology decisions, there are a few other places where I see Angular taking the advantage:
        <ul>
          <li>TypeScript > JSX</li>
          <li>Angular CLI</li>
          <li>The Angular documentation is better than the React documentation</li>
          <li>Not having to keep up with all the different libraries that do *insert thing here* in React</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Angular does have its own set of downsides though:
        <ul>
          <li>There's a large API surface area, so there's lots to learn</li>
          <li>Learning all of the ng-WhatHaveYous</li>
          <li>It can be heavy if you don't use Ahead of Time compilation/Lazy Loading/Tree shaking</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
