      <h4>Intro</h4>
      <p>
        A few years back, I got really interested in learning how web sockets work, so I built a small project to try them out. 
        For that project, I built an application where you could search for a stock ticker symbol and it would chart the last 
        100 days of activity on the stock market. It used websockets to update any clients that might be listening for changes 
        on the server. You can see that project, <a href="https://matty22chartstocks.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to use socket.io to complete that project and found it simple and enjoyable to work with. I gave this talk at 
        the BellevueJS meetup group in September 2017 to show attendees how easy it was to get started with web sockets.
      </p>
      <h4>Talk Overview</h4>
      <p>
        In the talk I quickly described what web sockets are and that they can help us to proactively update the client when the 
        server receives new updated information. In the traditional HTTP request paradigm, if one user does something and POSTs some 
        data to the server, a second user wouldn't see that change until they refreshed the browser so that their client would make 
        a new GET request to the server. Websockets allow the server to push changes to any client that might be 'listening' without 
        those clients have to make a GET request.
      </p>
      <p>
        A really good example that a lot of people are familiar with is Trello. If you open up two client instances of the same 
        Trello board and add a card on one, the other client will update without any additional request to the server. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After giving a good example of websockets in action, we walked through the chat application tutorial that the socket.io 
        website provides to quickly get started with web sockets. Then, I demonstrated the stock market ticker app that I referenced above.
